# IOT-LAB
The page could be made responsive by adding few css tags of meta and defining the screen size
Once card has been deployed to present that i have learnt how to use cards
The full screen search box will just require addition of javascript which was not performed due to lack of time

It will be of great help and amazing learning experience if you allow me to be a part of the IoT lab.
